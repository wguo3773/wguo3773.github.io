# About Me

I am a Biostatistician and PhD student at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. I specialize in EHR data analytics, causal machine learning, and single-cell multi-omics. I received my MS in Biostatistics from University of Florida, and MS (Thesis) in Pharmacology at McGill University. Previously, I received my Pharmacist training at University of Queensland, Australia, with first-class Honors.
